Calling st.pyplot() without providing a figure argument has been deprecated and will be removed in a later version as it requires the use of Matplotlib's global figure object, which is not thread-safe.

To future-proof this code, you should pass in a figure as shown below:

fig, ax = plt.subplots()
ax.scatter([1, 2, 3], [1, 2, 3])
# other plotting actions...
st.pyplot(fig)

If you have a specific use case that requires this functionality, please let us know via issue on Github.
